Jango
=====

Readme, examples, and many, many more updates coming soon.

### Todo

   * Return promises everywhere possible
   * Resolve with errors, parameters, etc
   * Tests for freaking everything!
   * Split up page creation, so one page is one "stack" and provides its own interface entirely (jango.create() should do this)
   * Possibly set up with Concrete/mocha/growl to run across all examples + tests?
   * Provide more BDD-style syntax and convenience methods, something like WebSpecter
   * Hubot plugin that provides control (start, stop, list, etc) and status reports (progress, errors, screenshots, etc), use Kue
   * Web UI for visually constructing test suites, make it super easy to rapidly pump out new suites (drag and drop, single-page, etc)
